# stock_portfolio

This project is a financial program, a portfolio investment tool.
The following modules are ready:
1. webscraper: S&P500 index and its components are downloaded from wikipedia, then historical closing prices are saved down using the tickers.
2. Basic statistics and calculations (log return, standard deviation, random portfolio generation, correlation matrix, asset performance comparison)
3. Portfolio generation: huge number of random portfolio generated to create the 'efficient frontier': these are the best portfolios with highest yield on a certain level of volatility (measure for riskiness) or the lowest level of volatility on a certain level of return.

The results with the default parameters are saved down in the 'output folder'. These figures are not invesment advice, only basic financial principals and their application using Python 3.8.
